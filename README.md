### Project Overview 

**Project Background**

This project is an independent extension of my university group coursework on predicting food insecurity in ASEAN countries using machine learning.

The original coursework focused on developing regression model using FAO and World Bank indicators to predict the prevalence of severe food insecurity or food insecurity rate.

For my portfolio, I expanded the project into an interactive Food Security Monitoring Dashboard by adding geographic visualization, time-series forecasting, and feature importance analysis to support policy-oriented insights.

The original coursework can be found on [github](https://github.com/Ruixue-Zhang/Data-Analytics-group-assignment/blob/main/Group%20Assignment%20Asean%20updated-latest.ipynb)

**Problem Statement**

Food insecurity remains a critical socioeconomic challenge across ASEAN countries, affecting population health, economic stability, and policy planning.

Governments require data-driven tools to monitor trends, identify key drivers, and anticipate future risk levels. However, existing analyses are often static and lack predictive capabilities.

This project develops a machine learning–based monitoring and forecasting system to support early detection and policy intervention.

**Real World Impact**

• Enables early detection of rising food insecurity risk


• Supports evidence-based policy decision


• Identifies key socioeconomic drivers affecting food securi 

y
• Provides future projections for intervention plann  

ng
• Improves resource allocation strategies
